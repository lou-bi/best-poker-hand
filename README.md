### Brief

Pick the best hand(s) from a list of poker hands.

See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands) for an
overview of poker hands.

Your function will receive an array of strings. Each string represents
a hand composed of 5 cards separated by spaces. A card is represented
by a number and its suit.

You are to return an array containing either the best hand or, in case
of a tie, the best hands. Each hand should be a string in the same
format as given to you initially as input.


### Coding the solution

Look for a stub file having the name poker.go
and place your solution code in that file.

### Running the tests

To run the tests run the command `go test` from within the exercise directory.

If the test suite contains benchmarks, you can run these with the `--bench` and `--benchmem`
flags:

    go test -v --bench . --benchmem

Keep in mind that each reviewer will run benchmarks on a different machine, with
different specs, so the results from these benchmark tests may vary.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Go best practices
- Show us your work through your commit history
- Completeness: did you complete the features? Are all the tests running?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?


### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes 
to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,
